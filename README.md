# EGE331-MatLab-Bingo Project Spring 2018
## Summary
This project was intended for one to use previous skills learned in class, and online resources to create the project. 
The bingo card it self starts up with randomly generated numbers in the correct range for the B,I,N,G, and O buttons as they would appear on a regular BINGO card. If a number is called, the user is to click on the number and the background will change to a red chip. The chip idea for the background was from the traditional game itself. In the traditional game if the bingo caller calls a letter and number one has, they will place the colored chip on that spot. Typically once they have five in a row, or the outside four corners the person will get bingo and the chips will be cleared. I was able to incorporate this functionality into the project as seen in Figures 1-4. I was also able to have the game put the different relating letters next to the number being called as seen in Figure 2. Once there are five in a row, the user is able to hit the reset button and the chips will be cleared with the exception of the “Free” box as seen in Figures 3-4. After that is done, the top buttons will go back to the initial state as seen in Figure 4.
